To model \na flow of control that winds through these objects and roles, you use an interaction \ndiagram; to show the passing of messages in the context of that structure, you use a \ncollaboration diagram, a kind of interaction diagram. \nTo model a flow of control by organization, \n Set the context for the interaction, whether it is a system, subsystem, operation, or class, or \none scenario of a use case or collaboration. \n Set the stage for the interaction by identifying which objects play a role in the interaction. \nLay them out on the collaboration diagram as vertices in a graph, placing the more \nimportant obje",
