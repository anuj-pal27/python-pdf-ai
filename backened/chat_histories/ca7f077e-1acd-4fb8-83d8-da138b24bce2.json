Freeze that scenario at a \nmoment in time, and render each object that participates in the mechanism. \n Expose the state and attribute values of each such object, as necessary, to understand the \nscenario. \n Similarly, expose the links among these objects, representing instances of associations \namong them. \n \nFor example, Figure shows a set of objects drawn from the implementation of an \nautonomous robot.

Classes \nUNIT -2 Part 1 \nBasic Structural Modelling \nClasses are the most important building block of any object-oriented system. A class is a \ndescription of a set of objects that share the same attributes, operations, relationships, and \nsemantics. A class implements one or more interfaces. \nYou use classes to capture the vocabulary of the system you are developing. These classes \nmay include abstractions that are part of the problem domain, as well as classes that make \nup an implementation. \nYou can use classes to represent software things, hardware things, and even things that are \npurely conceptual. \n \nGraphically, a class is rendered as a rectangle. \nFigure : Classes \n \nNames \nA class name must be unique within its enclosing package. Every class must have a name \nthat distinguish",
