Freeze that scenario at a \nmoment in time, and render each object that participates in the mechanism. \n Expose the state and attribute values of each such object, as necessary, to understand the \nscenario. \n Similarly, expose the links among these objects, representing instances of associations \namong them. \n \nFor example, Figure shows a set of objects drawn from the implementation of an \nautonomous robot.
